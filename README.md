# Open GL Pendulum  
  
This project was realised by Richard GUERCI, Erasmus student from TELECOM Nancy, France  
for CS426 - Computer Graphics - at National University of Ireland, Maynooth.  
  
This OpenGL program uses the C# programming language with freeGlut that models the physical behaviour of a pendulum in a system. It produces a 2D display of the ‘attractor’ (velocity vs position) of the system, as well as an animated 2D of the pendulum in motion.  
The motion of the object is controlled by a differential equation.
All variables can be changed (mass, forces, gravity, ...) with the keyboard.
